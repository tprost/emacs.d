# Keymap Overview

On Mac OSX, the "control" key is `C`, the "option" key is `M` and the "command" key is `s`.

## Basic Navivation

`C-f`
`C-b`
`C-p`
`C-n`
`C-a`
`C-e`
`M-f`
`M-b`
`M-e` go to end of the "sentence" (depends on the major mode I guess)
`M-a` go to beginning of the "sentence" (depends on the major mode I guess)

`M-p` ? five lines maybe?
`M-n` ? five lines maybe?

`C-/` undo
`C-SPC` set-mark-command

`<TAB>` auto complete (depends on major mode/context)

`C-x p ` 
`C-h b`

C-x p p         helm-projectile-switch-project
C-x p f         helm-projectile-find-file


This is a sentence. This is another sentence.


C-x should always be executing something
